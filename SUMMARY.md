# Project Summary

## Status: Ready for GitHub

### Completed Work

**Main Branch (production-ready)**
- Five interactive 2D visualizations using Canvas API
- Component names refactored from Slice1-5 to descriptive names:
  - VectorField: Eigenvector rays and vector transformation
  - GridDeformation: Grid warping and determinant visualization
  - CircleToEllipse: SVD vs eigendecomposition comparison
  - SpiralMotion: Complex eigenvalue spirals
  - JordanBehavior: Defective matrices and Jordan form
- Auto-preset selection per tab
- Clean navigation UI with clickable perspective guide
- All emojis removed from codebase
- Comprehensive README with deployment instructions
- Git repository initialized with clean commit history

**Feature Branch: feature/3d-visualization**
- Experimental 3D view using Three.js and React Three Fiber
- Shows 2x2 matrix transformation in 3D space (XY plane with Z-axis for depth)
- Interactive camera controls (orbit, pan, zoom)
- Eigenvectors rendered as 3D arrows
- Animated grid deformation in 3D
- Branch is separate and can be merged later if desired

### Technology Stack

**Current (Main Branch)**
- React 18
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Canvas API (hand-rolled)
- Zero external math libraries

**3D Branch (Experimental)**
- All above, plus:
- Three.js
- @react-three/fiber
- @react-three/drei

```

### Performance

- 60fps canvas rendering
- HiDPI-aware (devicePixelRatio scaling)
- Minimal allocations per frame
- Efficient vector field clipping

### Running the Project

Main branch (2D only):
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

3D visualization branch:
```bash
git checkout feature/3d-visualization
npm install  # Will install Three.js dependencies
npm run dev
```

### Next Steps for GitHub

1. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
git push origin feature/3d-visualization
```

2. Optional: Merge 3D branch if desired
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/3d-visualization
```

3. Deploy to GitHub Pages (instructions in README.md)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Why hand-rolled Canvas over D3/Chart libraries?**
   - Direct control for geometric transformations
   - Better performance for real-time animations
   - No unnecessary abstractions for linear algebra viz

2. **Why 3D is experimental (separate branch)?**
   - Adds ~500KB (Three.js) vs current ~50KB bundle
   - 2×2 matrices operate in 2D naturally
   - 3D provides depth but not essential for intuition
   - User can choose based on needs

3. **Component naming philosophy**
   - Descriptive over technical (VectorField vs Slice1)
   - Domain-driven (JordanBehavior vs Repeated5)
   - Consistent with math terminology

### Educational Value

Students/users should gain:
- Visual understanding that eigenvectors don't rotate
- Intuition for complex eigenvalues (no real invariant directions)
- Geometric meaning of determinant (area scaling)
- Distinction between eigen and singular decompositions
- Recognition of defective matrices through shear effects
